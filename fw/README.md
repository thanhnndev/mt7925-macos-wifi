# MT7925 firmware

Two blobs from [linux-firmware](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/mediatek/mt7925),
directory `mediatek/mt7925/`, unchanged. They are compiled into `itlmt7925.kext` (`kexts/itlmt7925/fw_blob.c`, `.incbin`)
because nothing can be read from disk in macOS Recovery at the time the driver starts.

License: [`LICENCE.mediatek`](LICENCE.mediatek) (copied verbatim from `LICENSES/LICENCE.mediatek` of linux-firmware). It permits
redistribution for use with devices containing MediaTek chipsets, provided the files are not combined into something that
requires them to be licensed under GPL/LGPL. The Clear BSD License of this repository does **not** apply to these files.

To use a newer firmware, replace both files with the ones from linux-firmware and rebuild. The driver parses the region
table of both images and waits for the firmware-ready bit, but a newer firmware may change command formats; the
driver has only been run against the versions above.
